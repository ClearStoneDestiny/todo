Variation of my "To Do list", with animation and popping messages.

This project has animations for the appearance of tasks, their deletion, and also pop-up text about changes in the list. There is also a memory effect, all added tasks will be saved on the userâ€™s device.

Working on this project I improved my skills in creating elements and interacting with them through the DOM tree.
Also improved my skills in working with local storage.

Below are screenshots of To Do:
